# Kredinbizde Service Application

Kredinbizde Service is a web application that allows users to apply for various loan and credit card products from multiple banks.


## Application Features

- Kredinbizde empowers users to apply for a variety of financial products, including consumer loans, vehicle loans, house loans, and credit cards.

- Users can open an account on KredinBizde and apply to any bank they wish. Their application will be evaluated by the bank they apply to and then communicated to the customer. This way, instead of applying to banks individually, customers utilize the KredinBizde application, which acts as an intermediary between banks and customers.

- Once the user's information is registered, they can apply with the necessary information at any time. This eliminates the need to open an account repeatedly.

- Credit cards can feature multiple campaigns as well. When applying for a credit card, customers can review these campaigns and apply accordingly.
